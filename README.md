# nstrumenta

### [nstrumenta cli](#cli)

- ~~manage~~ list your vm servers
- ~~publish your sandbox~~

### [nstrumenta javascript client module](#client)

The client module can be imported in node or web based javascript 

## <a name="cli"></a>cli

### quickstart

1. Have a project on nstrumenta
2. Get yourself an api key for remote access to that project from https://nstrumenta.com/projects/[project name]/settings
3. Install and configure

```
npm i -g nstrumenta
nstrumenta auth add 
```
4. When prompted, enter the project id and the api key
5. Open 3 terminals

#### terminal 1 server

```
nstrumenta context set-property wsHost --value ws://localhost:8088
nstrumenta serve
```

#### terminal 2 subscriber

```
nstrumenta subscribe
```

#### terminal 3 publisher

```
nstrumenta publish 
```

At this point you can send messages from the the terminal with the publishing process, and they'll be read and displayed by any subscriber process. Try typing something and pressing enter. Next up, try piping from the subscribe to another process or a file.

## cli reference

### install

```
npm install -g nstrumenta
```

### usage

```
nstrumenta [command]
```

nstrumenta will save your configuration. Within this configuration, you can define a set of individual contexts which will store information about the project you're currently working with and how you want to interact with this project. You can set the working project, a websocket server to work to act as a broker for all your sensor and client interactions, the channel you want to communicate with, etc. These settings can be overridden with arguments and options if needed.
